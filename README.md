# Guess The Number
Gaming application for android users

### This is a simple application in which a random number between 0 & 100 is generated and the user is supposed to try and guess what the number is.

### If incorrect, the application will respond with a response of "too high" or "too low".

### The user can guess until the correct answer is submitted, in which to game will alert you that you have guessed correctly.

##### Note: I do not know why there are fabs present in the screenshots; there are none in the actual app. Must be problems with the Android Studio emulator.

### Updates to be made
Range changes:
- Enable the random number range to be edited from the menu
  + Range 10
  + Range 50
  + Range 500
  + Range 1000
- Enable the hint from the number entry field to be updated for each range change available
- Remove the keyboard from the screen after the guess button is clicked

*Suggestions are welcomed!*
